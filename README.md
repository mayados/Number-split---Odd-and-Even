# Number split - Odd and even in C#

It's an exercise from my training. We create two loops : one for even numbers and one for odd numbers. We loop through numbers with a for loop. If a number is even we add it to the even list, and if it's odd we had it to the odd list. 

## What I learned

I learned lists in C# and practiced how to use them.
